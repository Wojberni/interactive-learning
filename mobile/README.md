# Setting up the application
 * (optional) run the server locally
 * generate api client and install dependencies using the following script (if you are using Windows, unlucky, you need to do it manually, just check the script for what's being executed)
    ```
    ./setup.sh <path_to_specification>

    path_to_specification is optional, if not provided it defaults to localhost
    ```
 * set the API_BASE_URL in .env file
 * run the application
